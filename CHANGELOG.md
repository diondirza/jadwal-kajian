# Change Log
All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.
This project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/).

NOTE: This isn't a traditional library style project for which semantic versioning makes sense, it's a project that you clone and extend to your own desire.  Therefore I am not using semantic version in a strict manner, but rather to indicate the level of changes that have occurred.

I'll map them as follows:
  - Major: Large application structure / technology changes. E.g. moving from react-router v2 to v4.
  - Minor: New features or changes to the build tools. Could contain some things that are traditionally know as breaking changes, however, I believe the upgrade path to minor.
  - Patch: Small(ish) fixes/restructuring that I expect will take minimal effort to merge in.
